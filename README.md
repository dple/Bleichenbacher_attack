Python implementation of Bleichenbacher's [adaptively chosen ciphertext attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_chosen-ciphertext_attack) against RSA encryption with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. Details of attacks could be found in this classical paper [*Chosen Ciphertext Attacks Against Protocols Based on the RSA Encryption Standard PKCS #1*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBFb0055716.pdf)
