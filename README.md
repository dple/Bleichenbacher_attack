# Bleichenbacher_attack

Python implementation of Bleichenbacher's [adaptively chosen ciphertext attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_chosen-ciphertext_attack) against RSA encryption with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. 

Details of attacks could be found in this classical paper [*Chosen Ciphertext Attacks Against Protocols Based on the RSA Encryption Standard PKCS #1*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBFb0055716.pdf). 

A very good explanation of the attack could be found [here](http://secgroup.dais.unive.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Practical-Padding-Oracle-Attacks-on-RSA.html).
